            I am a FrontEnd ReactJs Developer based in Argentina. I have a
            passion for learning new technologies and I am always looking for
            more. I've started learning about web development 1
            year ago and now im looking for a Job as FrontEnd Developer.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-500">
            Most of the time I'm looking for new experiences, since I've worked
            with teams, it made my way as Developer much easier and after being
            making my own projects, I've preffer joining a team to work hand to
            hand with them.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-500">
            Most of the my hobbies are listening to music (Arctic Monkeys, The
            Neighbourhood and Imagine Dragons are some of my favourite),
            watching movies (I love Interestellar and SuperHero's movies) and
            take pictures (even if I don't know how), also I'm a fan of Coffe (Like every programmer).
